### RECOMMENDED ABOUT SECTION:

```
"I don't know what business to start."

I've heard this from 200+ aspiring entrepreneurs.

The problem isn't lack of ideas.
It's lack of a framework to pick the RIGHT one.

Most people spend:
→ 6+ months "researching"
→ $2k+ on business courses
→ Endless hours watching YouTube

And still feel stuck.

Because more information doesn't solve decision paralysis.
You need a better filter.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY I BUILT THIS

I watched brilliant people:
• Have 10+ business ideas (never execute any)
• Start 3 businesses (quit all within 90 days)
• Build skills for jobs they end up hating

Not because they lacked talent.
Because they lacked CLARITY on:

1. What they're naturally good at (not learned skills)
2. What specific customers will pay them for
3. Where market demand actually exists

So I built a decision-making framework.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I BUILT

niche-tools = AI-powered niche discovery

Not business coaching.
Not a personality test.
Not ChatGPT prompt templates.

A structured extraction framework that analyzes YOUR unique background and generates:

✅ Specific customer persona (demographics + psychographics)
✅ Positioned niche statement ("I help [X] achieve [Y] in [Z] time")
✅ 3-6 viable monetization offers with pricing
✅ Real market validation data (TAM/SAM/SOM, competitors)
✅ 90-day roadmap to launch

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW IT WORKS

You answer 9 deep questions:
• What made you lose track of time at age 10?
• What issues keep you up at night?
• What do people naturally ask you for help with?
• What feels like play to you but work to others?

Our AI (GPT-4 + structured schemas) extracts:
→ Your natural skills (childhood flow states reveal authentic talents)
→ Emotional drivers (what problems you WANT to solve)
→ Core values (what positioning will feel authentic)

Then generates your complete business positioning.

Takes 10 minutes.
Free to start.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESULTS

1,000+ entrepreneurs have used niche-tools

Real outcomes:
• "I went from 8 months of research to launching in 30 days"
• "First $5k client within 2 weeks of finding my positioning"
• "$15k MRR in 90 days with my new niche"

Also built career direction tool:
• 8 Career Archetypes (Builder, Connector, Analyst, etc.)
• Specific role recommendations with salary ranges
• 90-day career transition roadmaps

500+ people found career clarity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I SHARE HERE

On this profile, I post about:
→ How to find your business niche (frameworks, not fluff)
→ Why "follow your passion" fails (and what to do instead)
→ AI + structured thinking for decision-making
→ Real user transformations (before/after positioning)
→ Career archetypes and how to use them

If you're stuck in analysis paralysis, follow me.

I'm building in public and sharing what works.

## Advanced: Company Page (Optional)

If you want to separate personal brand from company:

**Create LinkedIn Company Page:**

- Description: Similar to your About section
- Regular updates: Share product updates, user stories

**When to Create:**
- When you have a team (even small)
- When you want to run Company Page ads
- When you want to separate founder content from product content

**When to Skip:**
- Early stage, solo founder
- Personal brand IS the brand
- Want to keep things simple

For now, your personal profile is likely sufficient.
