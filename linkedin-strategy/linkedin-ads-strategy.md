# LinkedIn Ads Strategy for Niche-Tools

## Overview

LinkedIn ads are powerful for B2C professional products like niche-tools because:
- High-intent audience (people actively thinking about careers/business)
- Precise targeting (job titles, seniority, interests)
- Lead gen forms (reduce friction, no landing page needed)
- Professional context (users are in "career mode")

**Recommended Budget:** Start with $300-500/month ($10-15/day)
**Expected CPA:** $5-15 per registration (industry standard for lead gen)
**Timeline:** 30-day test, then optimize

## Ad Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 (Days 1-7): Broad Testing
- Run all ads simultaneously
- Equal budget distribution
- Gather data on what resonates

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Click-through rate (CTR) - Target: >1%
- Cost per click (CPC) - Target: <$5
- Lead form completion rate - Target: >30%
- Cost per lead (CPL) - Target: <$15

### Phase 2 (Days 8-14): Optimization
- Pause bottom 50% of ads
- Double budget on top performers
- Test new variations of winners

### Phase 3 (Days 15-30): Scaling
- Scale budget on proven winners
- Test new audiences
- Introduce retargeting

---

## A/B Testing Priorities

### Week 1-2: Test Ad Creative
- Problem-focused vs. solution-focused
- Success stories vs. frameworks
- Image styles (photos vs. graphics)

### Week 3-4: Test Audiences
- Job titles vs. interests
- Seniority levels
- Geographic variations

### Week 5-6: Test Lead Forms
- Length (more fields vs. fewer)
- Custom questions
- Headline variations

---

## Budget Allocation

**Total Monthly Budget: $450**

Campaign 1 (Business): $180/month ($6/day)
Campaign 2 (Career): $180/month ($6/day)
Campaign 3 (Retargeting): $90/month ($3/day)

**Expected Results (Conservative):**
- Impressions: 40,000-60,000/month
- Clicks: 400-600/month (1% CTR)
- Leads: 30-45/month ($10-15 CPL)
- Registrations: 20-30/month (conversion rate optimization needed)

**ROI Calculation:**
If 30 leads/month → 20 registrations → 2 paid conversions at $50 = $100 revenue
Spend: $450
Net: -$350/month initially

**Break-even:** Need 9 paid conversions/month at $50 each
**Growth Path:** Optimize for <$10 CPL, improve free → paid conversion

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Review CTR by ad (pause <0.8%)
- [ ] Review CPL by campaign (optimize >$20)
- [ ] Test 2 new ad variations
- [ ] Check lead quality (are they right audience?)

**Week 3:**

---

## Scaling Timeline

**Months 1-2: Testing ($450/month)**
- Goal: Find winning ads and audiences
- KPI: <$15 CPL, >30 leads/month

**Months 3-4: Optimization ($750/month)**
- Goal: Improve conversion rates
- KPI: <$10 CPL, >50 leads/month

**Months 5-6: Scaling ($1,500/month)**
- Goal: Profitable growth
- KPI: <$8 CPL, >100 leads/month, positive ROI

**Month 7+: Scaled Profitability ($2,000+/month)**
- Goal: Sustainable growth
- KPI: <$5 CPL, 200+ leads/month, 2:1 ROI minimum

---

## Alternative: Organic + Boosted Posts Strategy (Lower Budget)

If $450/month is too high, try this:

**Budget: $150/month ($5/day)**

1. Post organic content (see content calendar)
2. Boost top-performing posts ($30-50 each)
3. Target similar audiences as ads above
4. Test what resonates before running full campaigns

**Best Posts to Boost:**
- Carousels (high engagement)
- Success stories (social proof)
- "Find your archetype" posts (interactive)

**Advantages:**
- Lower commitment
- Tests content-market fit
- Builds organic following
- Learns what resonates before spending big

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower growth
- Less control over targeting
- Lower lead volume
