FRAMEWORK

```

---

### SLIDE 2 (The Problem)
**Header:** WHY MOST NICHES FAIL

**Content:**
```
❌ "I help people live better"
   → Too vague

❌ "I'm a business coach"
   → Not differentiated

❌ "I help small businesses"
   → Everyone says this

THE ISSUE:
Not specific enough to:
• Attract right customers
• Command premium prices
• Stand out from competitors
```

---

### SLIDE 4 (Dimension 1)
**Header:** 1. SKILL CLARITY

**Content:**
```
Not "what you learned"
But "what comes naturally"

ASK YOURSELF:
→ What feels like play to you
   but work to others?

→ What made you lose track
   of time as a kid?

→ What do people naturally
   ask you for help with?

EXAMPLE:
❌ "I'm good with people"
✅ "I diagnose communication
    breakdowns in remote teams"
```

---

### SLIDE 5 (Dimension 2)
**Header:** 2. PROBLEM CLARITY

**Content:**
```
Not "what people want"
But "what keeps them up at night"

ASK YOURSELF:
→ What urgent problem can
   you solve?

→ Who feels this pain most
   acutely?

→ Are they willing to PAY
   to solve it?

EXAMPLE:
❌ "People struggle with productivity"
✅ "SaaS founders waste 15 hours/week
    in misaligned meetings"
```

---

### SLIDE 6 (Dimension 3)
**Header:** 3. MARKET CLARITY

**Content:**
```
Not "who might need this"
But "who needs this NOW"

ASK YOURSELF:
→ Who is your SPECIFIC
   ideal customer?

→ Where do they spend time?

→ How competitive is this space?

EXAMPLE:
❌ "Small businesses need this"
✅ "Series A SaaS startups (20-50
    employees) in their first
    remote transition"
```
