# 30-Day LinkedIn Content Calendar for Niche-Tools

## Week 1: Problem Awareness + Foundation

### Day 1 (Monday) - Origin Story
**Type:** Text post (800-1000 characters)
**Goal:** Introduce yourself, build credibility, establish why this matters

**POST:**
```
I've talked to 200+ aspiring entrepreneurs in the past year.

They all struggle with the same thing:

"I don't know what business to start."

Not because they lack ideas.
Because they have TOO many.

The problem isn't creativity.
It's decision-making.

I watched brilliant people:
→ Spend 6 months "researching"
→ Start 3 different businesses
→ Quit all of them within 90 days

Because they never had a framework to pick the RIGHT one.

So I built one.

Niche-tools uses AI + structured frameworks to:
1. Extract YOUR unique skills (not what you think you should do)
2. Identify YOUR ideal customer (not "everyone")
3. Generate specific niche statements (not generic positioning)
4. Validate with real market data (not assumptions)

It's not business coaching.
It's not a personality quiz.
It's a decision-making framework.

And it's free to try.

More coming this week on how it works.

---

What's YOUR biggest struggle right now?
a) Too many ideas, can't pick one
b) No ideas at all
c) Have an idea but not sure it's viable

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - Problem-Aware Content
**Type:** Text post with bullet structure
**Goal:** Call out the pain point, show you understand them

**POST:**
```
3 signs you're stuck in analysis paralysis:

1. You've taken 5+ personality tests
MBTI, Enneagram, StrengthsFinder, Disc...
You have a folder full of PDFs.
Still no clarity on what to DO.

2. You have a "Business Ideas" note with 20+ options
Every week you add a new one.
You've never executed on any of them.
Because you don't know which one is "right."

3. You keep researching "best business to start in 2026"
You've watched 50+ YouTube videos.
Read 100+ articles.
Consumed more content than most MBA programs.
Still paralyzed.

Here's the truth:

More information won't solve this.
You need a better FILTER.

A framework that helps you:
→ Identify your natural skills (not learned skills)
→ Find specific customers with urgent problems
→ Match those two things into a viable offer

That's what I built niche-tools to do.

Tomorrow I'll share how the AI extraction works.

### Day 5 (Friday) - Thought Leadership
**Type:** Text post with framework introduction
**Goal:** Provide value, establish expertise

**POST:**
```
I analyzed 500+ "business ideas."

Here's the pattern that predicts success:

The Niche Clarity Matrix

Most people think about business ideas like this:
"I want to start a coaching business"
"I want to do consulting"
"I want to create content"

That's not specific enough to make money.

You need 3 dimensions of clarity:

1. SKILL CLARITY
Not "I'm good with people"
But "I can diagnose communication breakdowns in remote teams"

2. PROBLEM CLARITY
Not "People struggle with productivity"
But "SaaS founders waste 15 hours/week in misaligned meetings"

3. MARKET CLARITY
Not "Small businesses need this"
But "Series A startups (20-50 employees) in their first remote transition"

When all three intersect = Your Niche

The more specific you are, the easier it is to:
→ Attract the right customers
→ Command premium prices
→ Stand out from competition

Generic = Competing on price
Specific = Competing on fit

---

This is exactly what niche-tools helps you find.

It asks deep questions about YOUR skills.
Then matches them to specific customer problems.
Then validates market demand.

## Week 2: Solution Education + Social Proof

### Day 8 (Monday) - Solution Education
**Type:** Text post with comparison
**Goal:** Show why AI + frameworks > generic tools

**POST:**
```
I asked ChatGPT: "What business should I start?"

It gave me:
• Online coaching
• E-commerce store
• Affiliate marketing
• Content creation

Completely useless.

Then I tried Bard, Claude, and Perplexity.
Same generic garbage.

Here's why generic AI fails at niche discovery:

❌ It doesn't know YOUR specific skills
❌ It can't analyze YOUR childhood passions
❌ It has no framework for YOUR ideal customer
❌ It gives the same answers to everyone

So I built something different.

Niche-tools doesn't guess.
It EXTRACTS.

Here's how it works:

STEP 1: Deep Questions
• What made you lose track of time at age 10?
• What issues keep you up at night?
• What do people naturally ask you for help with?
• What feels like play to you but work to others?

STEP 2: AI Extraction
GPT-4 analyzes your responses using structured frameworks:
→ Identifies natural skills (not learned)
→ Maps emotional drivers (what you care about)
→ Extracts core values (what you stand for)

STEP 3: Niche Generation
Creates:
→ Specific customer persona (demographics + psychographics)
→ Exact niche statement ("I help [specific person] achieve [specific outcome]")
→ 3-6 viable offers with pricing guidance

STEP 4: Market Validation
Checks real market data:
→ TAM/SAM/SOM estimates
→ Competitor analysis
→ Supply/demand dynamics

No templates.
No generic advice.
Just YOUR unique positioning.

### Day 10 (Wednesday) - Behind the Scenes
**Type:** Educational post with technical insight
**Goal:** Build credibility, show sophistication

**POST:**
```
Behind the scenes: How our AI turns random answers into a $10k niche

Most AI tools use prompt templates.
You could build it yourself in 5 minutes.

We use structured extraction frameworks.
Can't replicate without serious AI engineering.

Here's what happens when you submit your persona:

LAYER 1: Skill Extraction
We don't ask "What are your skills?"
We ask "What made you lose track of time as a kid?"

Why?
Because childhood flow states reveal natural talents.
Not what you LEARNED to do.
What you were BORN to do.

Example response:
"I used to organize my friends' birthday parties"

AI extracts:
→ Event planning (obvious)
→ Stakeholder coordination (deeper)
→ Anticipating needs before asked (hidden skill)

LAYER 2: Problem Mapping
We analyze: "What issues keep you up at night?"

Example:
"I hate seeing talented people stuck in jobs they hate"

AI maps:
→ Target customer: Professionals in career transition
→ Pain point: Skills mismatch with role
→ Emotional urgency: Frustration + trapped feeling
→ Willingness to pay: HIGH (career change = major decision)

LAYER 3: Niche Synthesis
Combines skill + problem + market positioning:

"I help mid-career professionals (5-10 years experience) who feel trapped in technical roles transition into strategic leadership positions in 6 months without starting over."

Specific customer ✅
Specific problem ✅
Specific outcome ✅
Specific timeframe ✅

LAYER 4: Offer Generation
Creates 3-6 viable offers:
• 1:1 coaching ($3k-5k)
• Group program ($1k-2k)
• Self-paced course ($200-500)
• Done-for-you resume rewrite ($500-1k)

With delivery formats, pricing rationale, and market positioning.

LAYER 5: Market Validation
Pulls real data via Perplexity API:
→ Career coaching market size: $15B
→ Leadership transition demand: High
→ Competition level: Medium
→ Opportunity score: 8.5/10

This isn't a template.
It's a decision-making engine.

### Day 12 (Friday) - User Success Story #1
**Type:** Before/After transformation story
**Goal:** Social proof, show tangible results

**POST:**
```
"I help people feel better."

That was Sarah's positioning.

Great intention.
Zero business clarity.

She couldn't:
→ Explain who her customer was
→ Name a specific problem she solved
→ Justify why someone would pay her

She'd been "researching" for 8 months.
Spent $2k on business courses.
Still no revenue.

Then she tried niche-tools.

10 minutes later, she had:

"I help burnt-out corporate women in their 30s build $10k/month service businesses in 12 weeks without quitting their day job."

Look at the difference:

BEFORE:
• Customer: "People"
• Problem: "Feel better"
• Outcome: Vague emotional state

AFTER:
• Customer: Burnt-out corporate women, 30s
• Problem: Want business but can't quit job
• Outcome: $10k/month in 12 weeks

What changed?

✅ Specific customer (not "everyone")
✅ Specific problem (not generic pain)
✅ Specific outcome (measurable result)
✅ Specific timeline (urgency + credibility)

Results:

Week 1: Launched LinkedIn content with new positioning
Week 4: First paying client ($3k)
Week 8: 3 clients ($9k MRR)
Week 12: 5 clients, $15k MRR

She didn't need more courses.
She needed better positioning.

## Week 3: Thought Leadership + Product Features

### Day 15 (Monday) - Thought Leadership Framework
**Type:** Educational carousel post (see carousel template doc)
**Goal:** Shareable value, establish expertise

**POST TEXT:**
```
The 8 Career Archetypes (Based on 500+ User Analyses)

Personality tests tell you WHO you are.
But not WHAT to do with it.

After analyzing 500+ career discovery sessions, I found 8 patterns.

Each archetype has:
→ Natural strengths
→ Core motivations
→ Ideal work environments
→ Specific career paths

Swipe to find yours 👉

(Carousel content below - see carousel templates doc)

Drop your archetype in comments 👇
I'll reply with your ideal career match
```

**CTA:** Engagement + value exchange
**Time to Post:** 8-9 AM

### Day 17 (Wednesday) - Problem Content (Career Focus)
**Type:** Text post
**Goal:** Target career-change audience

**POST:**
```
"You'd be great in product management"
"Have you considered data science?"
"What about consulting?"

Everyone has opinions on your career.

Nobody has data.

Here's what actually matters when choosing your next role:

1. WORKING STYLE MATCH
Not "what skills do I have?"
But "how do I naturally work?"

→ Do you thrive alone or in teams?
→ Do you like building or strategizing?
→ Do you want predictability or variety?

Most career changes fail because of style mismatch.
Not skill mismatch.

2. VALUE ALIGNMENT
What makes work feel meaningful to you?

→ Problem-solving?
→ Helping people?
→ Creating something new?
→ Optimizing systems?

If your role doesn't align with core values = burnout in 18 months.

3. ENVIRONMENT FIT
Where do you do your best work?

→ Startup chaos or corporate structure?
→ Remote-first or office culture?
→ Leading teams or individual contributor?

A great role in the wrong environment = misery.

Here's what sucks:

Most career advice ignores this.
They focus on:
• Resume keywords
• Interview tactics
• Salary negotiation

But if you pick the WRONG role?
None of that matters.

---

I built the career direction tool to solve this.

It analyzes:
→ Your natural working style
→ Your core values
→ Your ideal environment

Then suggests:
→ Specific job titles with salary ranges
→ Skills gaps you need to fill
→ Portfolio projects to build
→ Certifications that matter
→ 90-day roadmap to get there

What's more important to you: Skills, values, or environment? 👇

### Day 19 (Friday) - Product Feature Deep Dive
**Type:** Educational post with screenshots (if possible)
**Goal:** Show value of premium features

**POST:**
```
We just shipped market validation data.

Here's why it matters:

Most people validate business ideas with:
• Google searches
• ChatGPT guesses
• "I asked my friends"

That's not validation.
That's hope.

Real validation needs:

1. MARKET SIZE DATA
→ TAM (Total Addressable Market)
→ SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
→ SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

Example:
TAM: Career coaching market = $15B
SAM: Leadership transition coaching = $2B
SOM: Your realistic 3-year capture = $500K

2. DEMAND INDICATORS
→ Search volume trends
→ Growth rate (YoY)
→ Seasonality patterns

Is demand growing or shrinking?
Can you predict revenue patterns?

3. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
→ Number of competitors
→ Their positioning
→ Price ranges
→ Market gaps

Where's the white space?
How differentiated are you?

4. SUPPLY/DEMAND DYNAMICS
→ Is this a local or global market?
→ Is it critical or nice-to-have?
→ Does it save time or grow revenue?

These determine:
• Your pricing power
• Customer urgency
• Competitive intensity

---

We pull this data automatically using Perplexity API.

You get:
✅ Real market research (not guesses)
✅ Competitive analysis
✅ Opportunity scoring
✅ Risk assessment

In 60 seconds.

Most business plans take 40 hours to research this.

### Day 22 (Monday) - User Success Story #2
**Type:** Career transformation story
**Goal:** Show career side of product

**POST:**
```
Marcus spent $15k on a coding bootcamp.

Hated it.

Not because coding was hard.
Because he was an ORGANIZER trying to be a BUILDER.

(Wrong archetype. Wrong career path.)

He came to niche-tools frustrated:
"I invested all this money. Do I have to start over?"

The career direction tool revealed:

NATURAL STRENGTHS:
→ Process optimization
→ Cross-functional coordination
→ Project planning
→ Stakeholder management

CAREER ARCHETYPE: Organizer
→ Thrives on structure
→ Loves making chaos orderly
→ Energized by logistics

IDEAL ROLES:
1. Technical Project Manager
2. Product Operations Manager
3. Implementation Consultant

Wait.

He didn't need to learn MORE coding.
He needed to apply his EXISTING skills... in tech.

90 days later:

✅ Landed Technical PM role at SaaS company
✅ Salary: $95k (up from $60k in previous role)
✅ Uses his organizational skills daily
✅ Works WITH engineers (doesn't have to BE one)

His bootcamp coding knowledge?
Actually useful now.
Because he can talk to engineering teams.

He didn't fail at coding.
He was just in the wrong role.

---

The difference between:
"I need to learn new skills"
and
"I need to apply my skills differently"

is career clarity.

### Day 26 (Friday) - Pattern Observation Post
**Type:** Data-driven insight
**Goal:** Establish authority, subtle product mention

**POST:**
```
I analyzed 1,000+ niche discovery sessions.

Here's what separates successful businesses from failed ones:

FAILED NICHES (Common Patterns):

❌ "I help people live better lives"
→ Customer: Too broad
→ Problem: Too vague
→ Outcome: Unmeasurable

❌ "I'm a business coach"
→ No differentiation
→ Competing on price
→ Race to the bottom

❌ "I help small businesses with marketing"
→ Every agency says this
→ No positioning
→ No premium pricing

SUCCESSFUL NICHES (Common Patterns):

✅ "I help B2B SaaS founders (Series A) reduce customer churn by 30% in 90 days using behavioral analytics"

→ Customer: B2B SaaS, Series A stage
→ Problem: Customer churn (urgent + measurable)
→ Outcome: 30% reduction in 90 days (specific + time-bound)
→ Method: Behavioral analytics (differentiation)

✅ "I help burnt-out corporate lawyers transition into legal tech product roles in 6 months without going back to school"

→ Customer: Corporate lawyers, burnt-out
→ Problem: Career transition without degree
→ Outcome: Legal tech product role in 6 months
→ Method: Leveraging existing expertise

✅ "I help first-time engineering managers build high-trust remote teams in 90 days using asynchronous communication frameworks"

→ Customer: First-time managers, engineering
→ Problem: Remote team building
→ Outcome: High-trust in 90 days
→ Method: Async communication (specific approach)

PATTERN:

Successful niches answer 5 questions:

1. WHO is your customer? (demographics + psychographics)
2. WHAT problem do they have? (urgent + specific)
3. WHAT outcome do you deliver? (measurable)
4. HOW LONG does it take? (time-bound)
5. HOW do you do it? (your unique method)

If you can't answer all 5, your niche isn't specific enough.

This is exactly what niche-tools forces you to define.

It won't let you be vague.
It extracts specificity from your answers.

### Day 29 (Monday) - Contrarian Take
**Type:** Opinion post (can be controversial)
**Goal:** Virality, engagement, reach

**POST:**
```
Unpopular opinion:

"Follow your passion" is terrible business advice.

Here's why:

Your passion doesn't care if anyone will PAY for it.

I've met:
→ Passionate artists who can't sell their work
→ Passionate coaches with zero clients
→ Passionate writers with no audience

Passion without positioning = expensive hobby.

The real formula:

VIABLE BUSINESS = Passion × Market Demand × Skill

Let me explain:

1. PASSION (What you care about)
Without this: Burnout in 18 months
With this: Sustainable long-term business

2. MARKET DEMAND (What people will pay for)
Without this: No revenue
With this: Profitable business

3. SKILL (What you're actually good at)
Without this: Imposter syndrome
With this: Premium positioning

You need ALL THREE.

Most people optimize for one:

❌ "Follow your passion" → Ignores market demand
❌ "Find a profitable niche" → Ignores passion (burnout)
❌ "Use your skills" → Ignores demand (no one wants it)

The sweet spot?

Where all three overlap.

That's your niche.

Example:

PASSION: You care about mental health
SKILL: You're great at organizational systems
DEMAND: Startup founders need burnout prevention

YOUR NICHE:
"I help startup founders build sustainable work systems that prevent burnout without sacrificing growth."

Not just passion.
Not just profit.
Both.

---

This is what niche-tools helps you find.

It extracts:
→ What you care about (passion)
→ What you're naturally good at (skill)
→ Who has urgent problems you can solve (demand)

Then shows you where they intersect.

### Day 30 (Wednesday) - Wrap-Up + Next Steps
**Type:** Reflective post with CTA
**Goal:** Consolidate value, drive action

**POST:**
```
30 days ago, I started sharing how to find your niche.

Here's what we covered:

✅ Why "follow your passion" fails
✅ The Niche Clarity Matrix (Skill × Problem × Market)
✅ 8 Career Archetypes and what to do with them
✅ How AI can extract YOUR positioning (not templates)
✅ Real market validation vs. guesswork
✅ User success stories (niche → $15k MRR in 90 days)

The response has been incredible.

1,000+ people tried niche-tools.
200+ found their positioning.
50+ launched businesses or changed careers.

If you're still stuck:

Ask yourself these 3 questions:

1️⃣ SKILL CLARITY
What do you do that feels like play to you but work to others?
(Not what you learned - what comes naturally)

2️⃣ PROBLEM CLARITY
What issue keeps you up at night?
Who else feels this pain?
Are they willing to pay to solve it?

3️⃣ MARKET CLARITY
Is there demand for this?
Who are your competitors?
What makes you different?

If you can't answer all three clearly:

You don't have a niche yet.
You have a vague direction.
